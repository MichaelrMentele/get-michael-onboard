This is a website for employers and clients to understand my capabilities as a software engineer.

# Status
Under construction. Basic resume and project guide are going up now but significant future work is being planned.

# Resume
It includes an online resume with projects and work history. It has a followup section linking to other projects and web presences hosted by yours truly.

# Guide to Relevant Projects
I have tens of thousands of lines of code on my github and making sense of it is confusing without a guide. So this website has an introduction including where to spend your time and what projects best summarize my capabilities.

# Interactive Timeline
A web application that looks at my history from building my first computer as a child to web sites in collges to deploying web applications and working with my first client.
