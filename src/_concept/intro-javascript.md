# Intro to Javascript

## What is javascript?

Javascript is the language that powers the internet. It lives on every computer, because every computer has a browser. 

I was talking to a mentor at Launchschool, Kevin Wang, about javascript and its monopoly on the browser.

Kevin was speculating in response to a question of mine that you may be able to use other languages that compile to JS and ultimately to C and in that way you'd be able to program in different languages for the frontend of application development.
