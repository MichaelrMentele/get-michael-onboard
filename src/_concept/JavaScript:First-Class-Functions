# JavaScript

When I was young and procrastinated I used to think curly braces were evil and that was my primary reason for not learning javascript. It looked weird and I didn't like it.

Foolishness.

## First Class Functions

## Function Expressions vs. Function Declarations

## Javascript compiler

## Hoisting

## Pass-by-Value

Everything in JS in pass-by-value, including functions. This is great. Why? Because everything that isn't a primitive (and immutable) is a container for a reference that points to an object in memory. That reference is a value. Some sequence of bits that addresses a location. This means we can pass that address around and call it in other.
