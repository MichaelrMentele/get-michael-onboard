    <p>I have a BS in Electrical Engineering and two years of experience as a Fortune 100 R&D power engineer working on critical infrastructure control algorithms shipped
      internationally at <a href="https://selinc.com/">SEL</a>.</p>

    <p>Last year I jumped the fence to full stack development. The change has been a long time coming; I built my first computer
    in middle school and built my first website when I was 15.</p>

    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am all about expansion. I love <a href="http://www.michaelrmentele.com/zero-to-backflip-3-hrs.html">learning new things</a>,
      I don't think <a href="http://www.michaelrmentele.com/learning.html">education</a> ever stops,
      I broke both feet overcommitting to <a href="http://www.michaelrmentele.com/marathon.html">running a marathon</a>,
      and I overcame not being able to walk by <a href="http://www.michaelrmentele.com/handwalking.html">picking up handwalking</a>.
      I am obsessed with feedback and use my journal to review myself. And I recommend Southeast Asia as a great place to backpack.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Interests</h3>
    <p>
      When I live alone, I tend to do things like organize my fruit by color and line up bell peppers in rows. I like clear separation,
      and organization and it shows in my code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like big data and I'm fascinated by difficult computational problems that require heuristically driven algorithms.
      In my last project, <a href="http://opensourcewatch.io">Open Source Watch</a> I scaled to several million requests per day
      against Github and created a custom priority queue scheme that allowed enque/dequeue in O(1) time and complete control over
      job frequency distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lately, I've been using Ruby/Rails, and related tech, but consider myself tool agnostic.
      I've written a number of <a href="http://getmichaelonboard.com/blog">articles on Javascript</a> and considered myself grounded
      enough in the language to quickly pick up the framework flavor of the week. In the past
      I've written code in Assembly, VHDL, C++, <a href="http://www.michaelrmentele.com/portfolio.html">C#</a>, Python, and more,
      for dabbling in VR development, embedded robotics, and data science.
    </p>

    <h3>What I can Offer</h3>
    <p>
      I take a stake in the things I do. I own them. What I can offer is autonomous,
      smart, driven, team-centric contribution.
    </p>

    <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
    <p>I'm looking for a team where I can both contribute and grow. That team should authentically
    back a clear mission and obsess about the quality of its product.</p>
